# climate-story

This project was created by Maggie Love and Mari Galicer in a 24-hour period for Science Hack Day (in conjunction with the NASA Spaceapps challenge).

Climate Story raises awareness about climate change by bringing local climate patterns and relevant Tweets together in one dashboard-like app.
